# Hepatitis
This is a machine learning project which gives a prediction of hepatitis patients
Accurate diagnosis for decision making in medical diagnosis is solicited for further treatment planning. 
Intelligent decision support system plays an important role for medical diagnosis as well as early detection of disease to survive. 
In intelligent model machine learning is achieved by searching a pattern in the available data set. 
For this reason, data pre-processing plays a vital role for better learning and analysis process. 
This work uses UCI Hepatitis disease data set. Missing data are managed by using multiple imputation. 
Feature extraction is done using machine learning techniques. 
Data pre- processing was the main focus to achieve better classification accuracy. Perceptron, Back Propagation Algorithm (BPA) , Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), and Self Organizing Maps (SOM) algorithms are used as classifier. 
The parameters â€“ Sensitivity, Specificity are considered for performance prediction.
